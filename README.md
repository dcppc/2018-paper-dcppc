Lessons learned (from assessment doc, sorted into catagories)
- Governance
  - decision making was unclear
  - The OT mechanism demands more work than it funds.
- Products and how they were handled
  - Many important technical achievements were completed during Phase 1.
  - Demos should result in tangible products that both impact our users and represent progress in our interoperation.
  - Deliverable evaluation was effective and necessary but changes should be made.
  - Project cadence was incredibly challenging.
- Community / communication
  - The face to face meetings were critical to Phase 1 performance and should continue, with modifications.
